# LED Matrix Research

Research on the display of shapes, numbers, and interactive games on a grid on an LED matrix display. This was initially forked from Andrew Wells's work and is now being continued by Daniel Tsivkovski (as of December 2023). This research work is being done under Dr. Maryam Etezad at Chapman University.
